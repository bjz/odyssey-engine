# Instructions

1. Edit the makefile to match your system's configuration
2. Build the project: `$ make`
3. ...then run it: `$ make run`

If you use Sublime Text, for convenience I've set it up so that it points to the Derelict3 and Phobos directories on my machine. You'll probably want to change those as well.

# Dependencies

- D2: http://dlang.org/
- Derelict3: https://github.com/aldacron/Derelict3
- GLFW: https://github.com/elmindreda/glfw
