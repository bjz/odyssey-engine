# Odyssey Engine

An experimental game engine written in D.

# Instructions

Note: I've only built this on OSX!

1. Go to the `test` directory
2. Edit the makefile to match your system's configuration
3. Build the project: `$ make`
4. ...then run it: `$ make run`
5. Alternatively, build and run in one step using `$ make br`

If you use Sublime Text, for my own convenience I've set up a project that points to the Derelict3 and Phobos directories on my machine. You'll probably want to change those paths depending on where you placed them on your system.
