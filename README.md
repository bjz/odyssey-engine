# Odyssey Engine

This is little game engine I'm writing in D to teach myself about computer graphics.

# Instructions

Note: I've only built this on OSX! You might have to change the makefiles to get them to work on your system.

If you use Sublime Text, for my own convenience I've set up a project in the sublimetext folder, but you might have to change the paths depending on where you've put things.
